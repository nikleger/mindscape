# Sprint Zero Planning

## Overview
Sprint Zero focuses on setting up the foundation for the Mindscape project, including infrastructure, development environment, and initial documentation.

## Goals
1. Set up development environment
2. Establish CI/CD pipeline
3. Create initial documentation structure
4. Define core architecture
5. Set up monitoring and logging
6. Implement basic security measures
7. Establish comprehensive testing framework

- Week 3: Security and Monitoring
- Week 4: Review and Refinement

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Development environment is fully functional
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline is operational
- [ ] Documentation structure is complete
- [ ] Core architecture is defined
- [ ] Basic security measures are in place
- [ ] Monitoring and logging are configured
- [ ] Testing framework is fully operational
- [ ] All test types are automated in CI/CD

## Dependencies
- [ ] Access to cloud infrastructure
- [ ] Development tools and licenses
- [ ] Team onboarding completed
- [ ] Security requirements defined
- [ ] Testing tools and frameworks
- [ ] Performance testing environment

## Risks and Mitigation
1. Infrastructure Setup Delays
   - Mitigation: Start with minimal viable setup
   - Contingency: Use local development environment

2. Documentation Overhead
   - Mitigation: Focus on essential documentation first
   - Contingency: Use templates and automation

3. Security Concerns
   - Mitigation: Implement basic security measures
   - Contingency: Regular security reviews

4. Testing Framework Complexity
   - Mitigation: Start with essential test types
   - Contingency: Focus on critical path testing

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve Sprint Zero plan
2. Assign tasks to team members
3. Set up initial infrastructure
4. Begin documentation setup
5. Start development environment configuration
6. Set up testing frameworks
