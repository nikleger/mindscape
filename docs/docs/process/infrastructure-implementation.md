- [ ] No CORS configuration
- [ ] Missing security headers
- [ ] No audit logging
- [ ] Incomplete authentication system
- [ ] Missing input validation
- [ ] No SQL injection prevention

### Monitoring Gaps
- [ ] No metrics collection
- [ ] Missing logging infrastructure
- [ ] No tracing setup
- [ ] Missing alerting system
- [ ] No performance monitoring
- [ ] Missing health checks

### Testing Gaps
- [ ] No test infrastructure
- [ ] Missing unit tests
- [ ] No integration tests
- [ ] Missing E2E tests
- [ ] No performance tests
- [ ] No security tests

### Infrastructure Gaps
- [ ] Missing CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] No database migrations
- [ ] Missing connection pooling
- [ ] No caching layer
- [ ] Missing backup system
- [ ] Incomplete documentation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Day 1-2)
1. CI/CD Pipeline
   - [ ] Set up GitHub Actions
   - [ ] Configure build pipeline
   - [ ] Set up deployment workflow
   - [ ] Implement quality gates

2. Monitoring Stack
   - [ ] Deploy Prometheus
   - [ ] Configure Grafana
   - [ ] Set up ELK stack
   - [ ] Configure AlertManager

### Phase 2: Security Implementation (Day 3)
1. Authentication & Authorization
   - [ ] Implement JWT system
   - [ ] Set up role-based access
   - [ ] Configure MFA
   - [ ] Implement session management

2. Security Measures
   - [ ] Implement rate limiting
   - [ ] Configure CORS
   - [ ] Add security headers
   - [ ] Set up audit logging

### Phase 3: Database & Caching (Day 4)
1. Database Infrastructure
   - [ ] Set up migrations
   - [ ] Configure connection pooling
   - [ ] Implement backup system
   - [ ] Set up monitoring

2. Caching Layer
   - [ ] Deploy Redis
   - [ ] Implement caching strategy
   - [ ] Configure cache invalidation
   - [ ] Set up monitoring

### Phase 4: Testing Infrastructure (Day 5)
1. Test Framework
   - [ ] Set up pytest
   - [ ] Configure coverage reporting
   - [ ] Set up E2E testing
   - [ ] Implement performance testing

2. Documentation
   - [ ] Document infrastructure
   - [ ] Create runbooks
   - [ ] Write monitoring guides
   - [ ] Document test procedures

## Quality Gates

### Security
- [ ] All security headers implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting functional
- [ ] Authentication system complete
- [ ] Audit logging operational

### Monitoring
- [ ] Metrics being collected
- [ ] Logs being aggregated
- [ ] Alerts configured
- [ ] Dashboards created

### Testing
- [ ] Test coverage >90%
- [ ] All critical paths tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Security tests passing

### Infrastructure
- [ ] All services operational
- [ ] Backups configured
- [ ] Monitoring operational
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|------------|
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Medium | Implement security measures first, run security scans |
| Performance issues | Medium | Medium | Set up monitoring early, establish baselines |
| Data loss | High | Low | Implement backup system, test recovery procedures |
| System downtime | High | Low | Set up proper monitoring, implement alerting |

## Next Steps
1. Begin with CI/CD pipeline setup
2. Implement core security measures
3. Deploy monitoring infrastructure
4. Set up testing framework
5. Document all implementations
