## Components

### DNS and CDN
- Route 53 for DNS management
- CloudFront for content delivery
- SSL/TLS certificates via ACM

### Compute
- ECS (Elastic Container Service) for container orchestration
- EC2 Auto Scaling groups
- Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution

### Database
- Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL (Multi-AZ)
- Read replicas for scaling read operations
- Automated backups and point-in-time recovery

### Caching
- ElastiCache Redis for session management and caching
- DAX for DynamoDB caching (where applicable)

### Storage
